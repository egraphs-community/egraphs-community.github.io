The EGRAPHS community brings together researchers and practitioners 
that use e-graphs and related techniques.
E-graphs are data structures for
 working with large equivalence classes of programs;
 they have recently been employed to build new kinds of 
 program optimizers and synthesizers.

        An e-graph compactly represents
        many equivalent programs.
        These four e-graphs represent more and more (even infinite!)
        ways to write <em>(a Ã— 2) / 2</em>.

- The annual [EGRAPHS Workshop](workshop/) co-located with the [PLDI](https://conf.researchr.org/series/pldi) conference.


All are welcome to join the EGRAPHS community by attending 
the monthly meeting,
