The EGRAPHS community brings together researchers and practitioners 
that use e-graphs and related techniques.
E-graphs are data structures for
 working with large equivalence classes of programs;
 they have recently been employed to build new kinds of 
 program optimizers and synthesizers.

        An e-graph compactly represents
        many equivalent programs.
        These four e-graphs represent more and more (even infinite!)
        ways to write <em>(a Ã— 2) / 2</em>.

This website brings together the following resources:
- A monthly [community meeting](meeting/) consisting of talks on Zoom.
- The annual [EGRAPHS Workshop](workshop/) co-located with the [PLDI](https://conf.researchr.org/series/pldi) conference.
- The [EGRAPHS Zulip](zulip/) to foster ongoing communication.

All are welcome to join the EGRAPHS community by attending 
the monthly meeting, 
joining the Zulip, 
or submitting to or attending the workshop.
The EGRAPHS community is organized by an cross-institutional [advisory board](about).
