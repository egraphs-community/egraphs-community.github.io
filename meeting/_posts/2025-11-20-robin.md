[Robin Coutelier](https://robcoutel.github.io/) from the [Vampire team](https://vprover.github.io/) will present his research on Probabalistic Security Analysis.

### Abstract

Abstract:
Side-channel attacks are powerful techniques to extract secret information from a system, measuring the side effects of, for example, a sequential circuit.
In this presentation, we discuss the open question of verifying countermeasure to power side-channel attacks. These methods involve the, notoriously difficult, probabilistic reasoning task. Orthogonally, equality graphs (Egraphs) showed great success using a saturation approach to term rewriting. We wish to harness this compact representation of equalities to prove correctness of probabilistic circuits.
However, some challenges remain. The goal of this presentation is to spark a discussion on sharing techniques between ATPs, SMT solvers and the world of Egraphs rewrite systems.
