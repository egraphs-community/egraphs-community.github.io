title: Synthesis of programs with local variables (and its applications to web automation)
author: Xinyu Wang
---

Xinyu will talk about a recent line of work that aims to synthesize web automation programs from user demonstrations. In particular, the talk will be focused on their [POPL 2024 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3632894) about how to synthesize programs with local variables. Xinyu will explain the key ideas in a general context. Then will connect it to web automation program synthesis: the connection involves how to use rewriting for programming-by-demonstration (more details: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523711), which I will also briefly explain. 

[Xinyu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan.
